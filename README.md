## SSBC - Simple Stack Based Computer
The SSBC is a simple turing complete system with only 11 instructions.

## Visual SSBC
This is a simple web-based interpreter and debugger for the machine. Run it in the browser over at [babakanoosh.github.io/Visual-SSBC](https://babakanoosh.github.io/Visual-SSBC/).

## Origin
Original machine specifications developed by [Dr. Peter Walsh](http://csci.viu.ca/~pwalsh/) at VIU and used for CSCI 261 - Assembly Languages. This web interpreter was originally developed by Dr. Julie Beeston and [hosted on her website](http://csci.viu.ca/~beestonj/csci261/index.html).

## Now
It is being updated by a student at VIU. 

The op-codes have been updated to work with the latest SSBC version. The "GUI" has been slightly re-done for ease of use. The code has re-structured, re-formatted, and re-factored for maintainability and updatability.

## TODO
- include ARTN
- include Architecture plan
- add header, and description of SSBC within webapp
- add dropdown menu
